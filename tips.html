    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">1. Understand the Basics</h2>
      <p>The Indian stock market is a platform where shares of companies are bought and sold. Before investing, learn the difference between primary and secondary markets, understand stock exchanges like BSE and NSE, and get familiar with common terms such as shares, dividends, indices, and market capitalization.</p>
      <p>Knowledge is power — spend time reading beginner-friendly books and tutorials on how stock markets function.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">2. Set Clear Investment Goals</h2>
      <p>Are you investing for long-term wealth, short-term gains, or retirement? Defining your goals helps you decide the investment style: conservative, balanced, or aggressive. It also determines the kinds of stocks or mutual funds you should consider.</p>
      <p>Always align your stock market investments with your financial goals and risk tolerance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">3. Do Thorough Research</h2>
      <p>Before buying shares, study the company’s fundamentals — its revenue, profit, debt, management quality, and future growth potential. Use trusted financial websites, annual reports, and market analysis.</p>
      <p>Keep an eye on macroeconomic factors like interest rates, inflation, and government policies that can impact the market.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">4. Diversify Your Portfolio</h2>
      <p>Don’t put all your money into one stock or sector. Spread your investments across different industries like technology, banking, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods. Diversification reduces risk by balancing losses in one area with gains in another.</p>
      <p>Consider adding mutual funds or ETFs for instant diversification with professional management.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">5. Start Small and Increase Gradually</h2>
      <p>It’s wise to begin with a small amount of money you can afford to lose, especially if you’re new. As you gain confidence and knowledge, gradually increase your investments.</p>
      <p>Use systematic investment plans (SIPs) to invest regularly and benefit from rupee cost averaging.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">6. Understand the Risks</h2>
      <p>Stock markets are volatile, and prices can fluctuate sharply. Be prepared for ups and downs and never invest money you might need urgently.</p>
      <p>Learn about risk management strategies like stop-loss orders, which automatically sell a stock at a certain price to limit losses.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">7. Avoid Herd Mentality</h2>
      <p>Don’t blindly follow market trends or tips from friends and social media. Every investor’s goals and risk appetite differ, so conduct your own research and make independent decisions.</p>
      <p>Stay calm during market volatility — impulsive decisions often lead to losses.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">8. Track Your Investments Regularly</h2>
      <p>Monitor your portfolio’s performance but avoid daily over-checking to prevent emotional reactions. Quarterly reviews help you decide whether to hold, sell, or buy more stocks.</p>
      <p>Use apps and tools to get real-time data and personalized alerts for better decision-making.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">9. Learn Technical and Fundamental Analysis</h2>
      <p>Fundamental analysis involves evaluating a company’s financial health, while technical analysis studies price charts and market trends.</p>
      <p>Mastering both gives you an edge in timing your buys and sells effectively.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">10. Stay Updated with Market News</h2>
      <p>Regularly follow reliable financial news sources, government announcements, and global economic developments. Market-moving events can create opportunities and risks.</p>
      <p>Be proactive — knowledge of upcoming IPOs, mergers, or regulatory changes can guide your strategy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">11. Consult Experts When Needed</h2>
      <p>If unsure, consider consulting a certified financial advisor or stock market expert. They can help tailor your investment plan to your goals and provide valuable insights.</p>
      <p>Attend workshops and webinars to build your knowledge and network with experienced investors.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h2 class="mb-3">12. Have Patience and Discipline</h2>
      <p>Successful investing is a marathon, not a sprint. Avoid chasing quick profits; instead, stick to your plan through market ups and downs.</p>
      <p>Reinvest dividends and stay focused on long-term wealth creation.</p>
